Definition (Primorial Of a Number)
Is similar to factorial of a number, In primorial, not all the natural numbers get multiplied, only prime numbers are multiplied to calculate the primorial of a number. It's denoted with P#.

Task
Given a number N , calculate its primorial. !alt  !alt

Notes
Only positive numbers will be passed (N > 0) .
Input >> Output Examples:
1- numPrimorial (3) ==> return (30)
Explanation:
Since the passed number is (3) ,Then the primorial should obtained by multiplying 2 * 3 * 5 = 30 .

Mathematically written as , P3# = 30 .
2- numPrimorial (5) ==> return (2310)
Explanation:
Since the passed number is (5) ,Then the primorial should obtained by multiplying 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 = 2310 .

Mathematically written as , P5# = 2310 .
3- numPrimorial (6) ==> return (30030)
Explanation:
Since the passed number is (6) ,Then the primorial should obtained by multiplying 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 = 30030 .

Mathematically written as , P6# = 30030 .
